# Intro_to_data_vis_lab_2
This assignment is utilizing D3 to create visualizations based on a climate data set. To open click on the index.html file, if the file is not working please try to open on a local file or open via https://github.com/Calebwoe/Intro_to_data_vis_lab_2/settings/pages which should include the scatterplot. Additionally I have attatched a screenshot of the Scatterplot in the file. The sketches are all attatched as a different document not in github.
